# Flan-Diddly-Danders

In this app I am trying some React concepts with Codesandbox, an online IDE for more rapid deployment.

- Elements and Components and more ES6.
- Working with JSX in more detail
- State and Lifecycle when to use and when to not manipualte
- Working with Forms. Since React handes forms differently then its HTML   counterpart getting a handle on this concept is crutial.
- Creating Dumb/Stateless Components


Flan-Diddly-Danders is a Google clone for dad jokes and only dad jokes; its clean, corny humor. Enter your dad joke topic and get the top 5 dad joke results for that search term, or enter your search term & press the "I'm feeling funny" button for a single dad joke on topic. 

I hope you enjoy,

-Mia

P.S. Plus its my dads Birthday in a few days (love you dad) :D
